The Wildlife Tracker app was created using the Full Stack Rails framework. Some of the tools I used include Javascript, AJAX, the FullCalendar jQuery plugin, ActiveRecord and Postgres database tables. This app was created to be a resource for a National Park Ranger who has been tasked with an environmental impact study tracking the wildlife in the Oregon Forest. 

The user can:
Create and record sightings for individual animals (as well as read, edit and destroy)
View all the sightings on a calendar
Sort and filter sightings by date
Create and assign sightings to individual Rangers
Assign the sighting to a region.
